Monster Hunter Monster Icons
============================

The purpose of this repo is to store vector versions of monster icons from
 the Monster Hunter video game franchise. The initial idea is to have these
 available to inscribe on children's wooden block toys, such as Tegu magentic
 wooden blocks. 

Tegu Magnetic Blocks Inscription
--------------------------------

Initially this was done using a Full Spectrum Engineering Laser Cutter/Engraver.
 I think the model I was using was part of the H-Series, but I no longer have
 access to that unit and did not write down any specifics. 

TODO: Add details for engraving using the new Laser Wood Cutter in the FFL
 makerspace.
